  <h3 translate>
    General Information on the Legal Basis for Data Processing on this Website
  </h3>
  <p translate>
    If you have given consent for data processing, we process your personal data
    based on Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a DSGVO (General Data Protection Regulation) or
    Art. 9 para. 2 lit. a DSGVO, if special categories of data are processed
    according to Art. 9 para. 1 DSGVO. In the case of explicit consent for the
    transfer of personal data to third countries, data processing is also based
    on Art. 49 para. 1 lit. a DSGVO. If you have given consent for the storage
    of cookies or access to information on your device (e.g., via device
    fingerprinting), data processing is additionally based on § 25 para. 1
    TTDSG. Consent can be revoked at any time. If your data is necessary for the
    performance of a contract or for the implementation of pre-contractual
    measures, we process your data based on Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b DSGVO.
    Furthermore, we process your data if it is necessary to fulfill a legal
    obligation based on Art. 6 para. 1 lit. c DSGVO. Data processing may also be
    carried out on the basis of our legitimate interest according to Art. 6
    para. 1 lit. f DSGVO. The relevant legal bases for the specific cases are
    explained in the following paragraphs of this Privacy Policy.
  </p>
  <h3 translate>Recipients of Personal Data</h3>
  <p translate>
    In the course of our business activities, we work with various external
    entities. In some cases, it is necessary to transmit personal data to these
    external entities. We only disclose personal data to external entities when
    it is required for contract fulfillment, when we are legally obligated to do
    so (e.g., disclosure of data to tax authorities), when we have a legitimate
    interest according to Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f DSGVO in the disclosure, or when
    another legal basis allows for data disclosure. When using data processors,
    we only disclose personal data of our customers based on a valid data
    processing agreement. In the case of joint processing, a joint processing
    agreement is concluded.
  </p>
  <h3 translate>Revocation of Your Consent for Data Processing</h3>
  <p translate>
    Many data processing operations are only possible with your express consent.
    You can revoke consent that has already been given at any time. The
    lawfulness of data processing carried out before the revocation remains
    unaffected by the revocation.
  </p>
  <h3 translate>
    Right to Object to Data Collection in Special Cases and Direct Marketing
    (Art. 21 DSGVO)
  </h3>
  <p translate>
    IF DATA PROCESSING IS BASED ON ART. 6 PARA. 1 LIT. E OR F DSGVO, YOU HAVE
    THE RIGHT TO OBJECT TO THE PROCESSING OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA AT ANY TIME FOR
    REASONS ARISING FROM YOUR PARTICULAR SITUATION, INCLUDING PROFILING BASED ON
    THESE PROVISIONS. THE RESPECTIVE LEGAL BASIS ON WHICH PROCESSING IS BASED
    CAN BE FOUND IN THIS PRIVACY POLICY. IF YOU OBJECT, WE WILL NO LONGER
    PROCESS YOUR AFFECTED PERSONAL DATA, UNLESS WE CAN DEMONSTRATE COMPELLING
    LEGITIMATE GROUNDS FOR THE PROCESSING WHICH OVERRIDE YOUR INTERESTS, RIGHTS,
    AND FREEDOMS, OR THE PROCESSING SERVES THE ASSERTION, EXERCISE, OR DEFENSE
    OF LEGAL CLAIMS (OBJECTION PURSUANT TO ART. 21 PARA. 1 DSGVO).
  </p>
  <p translate>
    IF YOUR PERSONAL DATA IS PROCESSED FOR THE PURPOSE OF DIRECT ADVERTISING,
    YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO OBJECT AT ANY TIME TO THE PROCESSING OF PERSONAL DATA
    CONCERNING YOU FOR THE PURPOSE OF SUCH ADVERTISING, INCLUDING PROFILING TO
    THE EXTENT THAT IT IS RELATED TO SUCH DIRECT ADVERTISING. IF YOU OBJECT,
    YOUR PERSONAL DATA WILL SUBSEQUENTLY NO LONGER BE USED FOR THE PURPOSE OF
    DIRECT ADVERTISING (OBJECTION PURSUANT TO ART. 21 PARA. 2 DSGVO).
  </p>
  <h3 translate>Right to Lodge a Complaint with the Supervisory Authority</h3>
  <p translate>
    In the event of violations of the DSGVO, data subjects have the right to
    lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, in particular in the member
    state where they usually reside, work, or where the alleged violation
    occurred. The right to lodge a complaint is without prejudice to other
    administrative or judicial remedies.
  </p>
  <h3 translate>Right to Data Portability</h3>
  <p translate>
    You have the right to have data that we process automatically on the basis
    of your consent or in fulfillment of a contract handed over to yourself or
    to a third party in a standard, machine-readable format. If you request the
    direct transfer of the data to another controller, this will only be done to
    the extent technically feasible.
  </p>
  <h3 translate>Information, Correction, and Deletion</h3>
  <p translate>
    Within the scope of the applicable legal provisions, you have the right to
    obtain free information about your stored personal data, its origin and
    recipient, and the purpose of data processing at any time and, if necessary,
    a right to correct or delete this data. For this purpose, as well as for any
    other questions regarding personal data, you can contact us at any time.
  </p>
  <h3 translate>Right to Restriction of Processing</h3>
  <p translate>
    You have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your
    personal data. You can contact us at any time for this purpose. The right to
    restrict processing exists in the following cases:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li translate>
      If you dispute the accuracy of your personal data stored with us, we
      usually need time to verify this. For the duration of the examination, you
      have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your
      personal data.
    </li>
    <li translate>
      If the processing of your personal data is unlawful, you can request the
      restriction of data processing instead of deletion.
    </li>
    <li translate>
      If we no longer need your personal data, but you need it for the exercise,
      defense, or assertion of legal claims, you have the right to request the
      restriction of the processing of your personal data instead of deletion.
    </li>
    <li translate>
      If you have filed an objection pursuant to Art. 21 para. 1 DSGVO, a
      balance must be struck between your interests and ours. As long as it is
      not yet clear whose interests outweigh the interests, you have the right
      to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p translate>
    If you have restricted the processing of your personal data, these data -
    apart from their storage - may only be processed with your consent or for
    the assertion, exercise, or defense of legal claims or for the protection of
    the rights of another natural or legal person or for reasons of important
    public interest of the European Union or a member state.
  </p>
  <h2 translate>4. Data Collection on this Website</h2>
  <h3 translate>Contact Form</h3>
  <p translate>
    If you send us inquiries via the contact form, your data from the inquiry
    form, including the contact details you provided there, will be stored by us
    for the purpose of processing the inquiry and in the event of follow-up
    questions. We do not pass on this data without your consent.
  </p>
  <p translate>
    The processing of this data is based on Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b DSGVO, if your
    inquiry is related to the fulfillment of a contract or is necessary for the
    implementation of pre-contractual measures. In all other cases, the
    processing is based on our legitimate interest in the effective processing
    of inquiries submitted to us (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f DSGVO) or on your
    consent (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a DSGVO) if this has been requested; the
    consent can be revoked at any time.
  </p>
  <p translate>
    The data you send to us via contact inquiries will remain with us until you
    request deletion, revoke your consent to storage, or the purpose for data
    storage no longer applies (e.g., after your inquiry has been completed).
    Mandatory legal provisions, especially statutory retention periods, remain
    unaffected.
